  description: "FLAME GPU is a high performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) extension to the FLAME framework. It provides a mapping between a formal agent specifications with C based scripting and optimised CUDA code. This includes a number of key ABM building blocks such as multiple agent types, agent communication and birth and death allocation. The advantages of our contribution are three fold. Firstly Agent Based (AB) modellers are able to focus on specifying agent behaviour and run simulations without explicit understanding of CUDA programming or GPU optimisation strategies. Secondly simulation performance is significantly increased in comparison with desktop CPU alternatives. This allows simulation of far larger model sizes with high performance at a fraction of the cost of grid based alternatives. Finally massive agent populations can be visualised in real time as agent data is already located on the GPU hardware."

- name: "Repast HPC"
  description: "Repast for High Performance Computing (Repast HPC) 2.1, released on 8 May 2015, is a next generation agent-based modeling system intended for large-scale distributed computing platforms. It implements the core Repast Simphony concepts (e.g. contexts and projections), modifying them to work in a parallel distributed environment. Repast HPC is written in cross-platform C++. It can be used on workstations, clusters, and supercomputers running Apple Mac OS X, Linux, or Unix. Portable models can be written in either standard or Logo-style C++. Repast HPC has been successfully tested for scalability on Argonne National Laboratory's Blue Gene P. "

- name: "D-MASON"
  description: "DMASON 3.0.2 released on September 2015, is a parallel version of the MASON, a Java library for writing and running Agent-Based Simulations. DMASON at beginning was designed to harness heterogeneous system, currently faces also the power of large-scale distributed computing systems and cluster environments. DMASON uses the Master Worker paradigm for work partitioning and Publish and Subscribe paradigm for the communication among the nodes, it provides both centralized and decentralized communication mechanisms.DMASON consists in three main layers: Distributed Simulation (that includes MASON), Communication (JMS and MPI), Visualization."
