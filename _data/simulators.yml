  description: "DMASON 3.0.2 released on September 2015, is a parallel version of the MASON, a Java library for writing and running Agent-Based Simulations. DMASON at beginning was designed to harness heterogeneous system, currently faces also the power of large-scale distributed computing systems and cluster environments. DMASON uses the Master\Worker paradigm for work partitioning and Publish\Subscribe paradigm for the communication among the nodes, it provides both centralized and decentralized communication mechanisms.DMASON consists in three main layers: Distributed Simulation (that includes MASON), Communication (JMS and MPI), Visualization."
