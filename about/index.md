# About

The purpose of the OpenAB initiative is to;

1. Discuss the purpose and rationale behind benchmarking of multi agent models for parallel and distributed systems
2. Understand and share existing benchmark models following a set of community driven rules to ensure a high standard.
3. Propose and agree on potential models for understanding scaling of different aspects of multi agent models (beyond just population sizes).
4. Propose and agree of processes and methodologies for benchmarking multi-agent models.

The outcome of the initiative is hoped to be;

1. A set of reference benchmark models and published set of procedures to be used when exploring performance oriented simulation or model implementation on parallel and distributed systems.
2. A published set of benchmark results for a wide range of reference models in a range of supported simulators to give insight to model designers about the suitability of simulators and computer architectures.
