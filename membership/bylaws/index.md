# Bylaws

The goals of the OpenAB Committee are to:

a. _Promote the use and further expansion of the OpenAB benchmarks and benchmarking best practices._
b. _Maintain and update the OpenAB website and facilitate discussion around best practices._
c. _Oversee and organise peer review of benchmark models to ensure that they are of high quality._

The committee has active and corresponding members. Active members can vote and are expected to work towards achieving the goals of the committee. Active members are responsible for the peer reviewing of models reporting to the chair or co-chairs.

Corresponding membership is open to all and is facilitated by the public discussion group.

The committee has a chair and two co-chairs who are elected for two years by a simple majority of its active members. The chair can be replaced if a majority of active members decides so. The chair and co-chairs makes sure that the committee performs its tasks in an orderly manner and is responsible for making decisions about model inclusion and setting the scope of the initiative. The chair is the official contact person for the committee.

The committee follows the published benchmark submission rules to guide acceptance of new benchmark models. Modification to the benchmark rules or bylaws can be suggested by any member but must be put forward for consideration by an active member or chair/co-chair. Changes to the rules will be decided by a consensus within the active members. In case no consensus can be reached a vote will be taken. For most matters a simple majority of votes will decide; in case of a tie the chair has the tie-breaking vote. 

Most committee business, including voting, is conducted using electronic communication. Members are expected to respond within one week to e-mails unless they announced a prolonged absence. In the case of voting a lack of response within two weeks is considered an abstain. The records of the electronic communication are the minutes of the committee.

The committee can invite additional active members or consider application of new active members. Any active member who is unable to take part in peer review or abstains from voting on more than 3 occasions per year may be removed from the committee by decision of the chair. 

Any active member can decide to leave the committee by writing the chair about the resignation.
